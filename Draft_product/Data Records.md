Data Records
The Data Records section should be used to explain each data record associated with this work, the location where this information is stored, and to provide an overview of the data files and their formats. This should include the initial data you choose for analyses. A notation should also be placed in the Methods containing the data-collection or analytical procedure(s) used to derive the corresponding record. Summary Tables and Figures should be used to support the data records.
