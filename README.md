###Directory structure
The following is the directory structure for the project. The Data directory houses the primary data (mostly FASTA transcriptome files) used for analyses. This directory is further broken down into a directory for each species (NOTE: some have not been created yet). The Anlayses directory is where files produced from analyses are kept. This directory is also broken down by species. The nb directory is where iPython notebooks are kept. The Scripts directory is where scripts are kept.
