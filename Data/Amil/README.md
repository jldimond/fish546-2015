The FASTA file Amil_Moya.fasta is a transcriptome for *Acropora millepora* downloaded from NCBI at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=74409%5BBioProject%5D on 2/5/2015. It was featured in an article by [Moya et al. (2012)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05554.x/full). The transcriptome was developed from newly settled polyps without symbionts.

The file Moya_OA_genes.csv is a list of differentially expressed contigs in response to ocean acidification derived from a [supplementary data file](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05554.x/asset/supinfo/MEC_5554_sm_FigS1-S3_TableS1-S9.pdf?v=1&s=8986ebf969c7552ad857973fff80a0752f87a129) featured in the same article above. The contig IDs are the same as in the transcriptome and can be joined using common contig IDs.

The file Shearer_Macroalgal.fasta is a FASTA file of differentially expressed genes in response to macroalgal contact over a period of 6 *or* 48 hours in *A. millepora*. To retrieve this FASTA file from GenBank, a list of accession numbers was derived from a [supplementary file](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?unique&id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0114525.s002). This data was featured in an article by [Shearer et al. 2014](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0114525#pone.0114525.s002).
