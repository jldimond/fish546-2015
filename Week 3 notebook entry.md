Last week I spent all day Thursday and Friday in SW Carpentry. This was very useful and relevant to this class. I learned much more about bash, Git, SQLite, and iPython. The Git and SQL sessions were particularly helpful. Nonetheless, some of my progress in class this week was stymied by an inability to get my local repository synced with my online repository. I tried using a Linux Git GUI that Sam recommended called SmartGit, but I had trouble with it and instead reverted to using the command line. So now I do have my A. hyacinthus directory mostly in order, and have worked on an iPython notebook to calculate CpG ratio. But there's much more to be done. I still to get many of the env response gene datasets in order, which is turning out to be quite challenging in some cases. Often I can find sequence IDs for the genes, but no sequences or accession numbers, so I have to figure out how to connect the sequence IDs back to the appropriate transcriptome. And sometimes the seq IDs are in Word Docs or pdf files which can be a nightmare to extract the data from. This has been a good lesson in why it's important to make your science as open and reproducible as possible.:+1:
